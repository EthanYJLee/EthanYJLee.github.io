      "I have built a career focused on backend service operation and maintenance. After acquiring an existing service at a startup, I have performed code refactoring, feature improvements, server migrations, and deployments to enhance service stability. Particularly, I have been responsible for operating APIs directly connected to user interfaces, reproducing errors and analyzing causes to improve them. I aim to be a backend developer who consistently provides stable services like home, product, and content by identifying and fixing even small issues."

I'm particularly interested in analyzing user behavior based on data and leveraging insights to improve services. I aim to be a problem-solving developer who is capable not only in development but also in data analysis."
